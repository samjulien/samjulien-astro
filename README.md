# SamJulien.com

Hi, I'm Sam Julien, director of Developer Relations and AI engineer. This is the repo for [my personal website](http://www.samjulien.com), built with [Astro](https://astro.build/). [Vojta](http://vojta.io) did the foundational design for this site. It's hosted on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).

I migrated from Gatsby using the [migrating from Gatsby](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/migrate-to-astro/from-gatsby/) guide with the help of [Bolt.new](https://bolt.new/), and [Cursor](https://www.cursor.so/).

This is my [now page](https://nownownow.com/about), inspired by Derek Sivers. It's a snapshot of what I'm focused on at this point in my life.

## Current focus

I have two main focuses right now:

1. Provide for my family while spending as much time as possible with them
2. Help developers around the world navigate the rapidly changing landscape of AI engineering and its impact on traditional web and software development

## Personal

I'm having a great time with my wife, son, and dog in the Pacific Northwest. Currently spending a lot of time playing with my son at parks, playgrounds, and out in nature whenever the weather permits. His language is developing rapidly and it's a ton of fun to watch.

## Creative work

I've recently gotten back into writing and coding. I [rebuilt this website with Astro](/migrating-from-gatsby-to-astro), wrote a series on [building a developer motion](/building-a-developer-motion) and a series on [preventing and managing burnout using a progress system](/understanding-burnout), and am now working on building an AI-powered knowledge work pipeline. I'm also sending more updates out via my newsletter, so be sure to sign up below.

## Day job

I'm currently working as the Director of Developer Relations at [Writer](https://writer.com), an enterprise AI platform, where I lead a team of Developer Experience (DX) engineers and Developer Advocates. I oversee all of our [developer docs and SDKs](https://dev.writer.com/) and co-lead all of our technical and developer marketing alongside the Product Marketing team. I recently oversaw all of the engineering and marketing for our [SDK 2.0 release](https://writer.com/engineering/sdk-2-0/) and our [LangChain](https://writer.com/engineering/langchain-writer/) and [Instructor](https://python.useinstructor.com/integrations/writer/) integrations. I also led a cross-functional team in sponsoring [AI Engineer Summit](https://www.ai.engineer/summit) and spoke at [AI Engineer World's Fair](https://www.ai.engineer/summit). It's an intense, fast-paced job but incredibly interesting and engaging. I honestly can't believe how lucky I am to have a front-row seat to the AI revolution.

## Learning

Here's what I'm currently learning:

- Diving deeper into AI engineering, especially evals through [Hamel Hussain](https://x.com/HamelHusain) and [Shreya Shankar](https://x.com/sh_reya)'s incredible [AI evals course](https://maven.com/parlance-labs/evals?promoCode=evals-faq-new)
- Scratching the surface of Machine Learning and Deep Learning, starting with shoring up my foundations in linear algebra and statistics
- Slow productivity: how do I do less, but better? How do I work at a natural pace?

Migrating from AngularJS to Angular can be really overwhelming. How on earth do you figure out where to even begin? I have a talk called "Finding the Right Path from AngularJS to Angular" that goes over a decision tree you can use to determine this. The recording is available for free:

If you need more help with ngUpgrade, check out [Upgrading AngularJS](https://www.upgradingangularjs.com/), my comprehensive video course on ngUpgrade. There are over 230 videos to walk you step-by-step through the process.

If your company needs more hands-on help with migration, I offer [remote migration consultations](https://www.upgradingangularjs.com/consulting). The most popular option is a full day review where we develop a customized action plan for your migration. We look at your build process, the current state of your legacy codebase, and anticipate any barriers you may have.

## Upgrading from AngularJS to Angular: The Four Paths

The (roughly) four paths for migrating from AngularJS to Angular are:

1. Rewrite/burn everything to the ground, sometimes called a "big bang" approach
2. ngUpgrade, a library from the Angular team that lets you run AngularJS and Angular side-by-side
3. Hybrid Routing, which involves one frameowrk owning one route. This can be done client side with ngUpgrade or server side.
4. Angular Elements, which are web components for Angular. These are like tiny frontends you can stick anywhere, including your legacy AngularJS code.

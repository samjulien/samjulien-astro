Back in 2020 and 2021, I was churning out content I was really proud of, but when I became manager, then director, and, most importantly, a father, things changed. Now I need to work ten times faster, not only because I'm working at an AI startup (though that certainly adds pressure), but because I want to be fully present with my son and family.

Like any good engineer, I started looking for tools to solve this problem, and voice seemed like the obvious solution. Dictation is 10x faster than typing, and I've been using it for several years after a run-in with severe hand pain in 2021. Now with AI, dictation is at a whole new level.

As I was exploring this, I came across this excellent [voice-to-content section](https://hamel.dev/blog/posts/audience/#build-a-voice-to-content-pipeline) in an article by [Hamel Husain](https://x.com/hamelhusain?s=21). Since then, a few other people have chimed in on this subject. 

Unfortunately, most of these social posts and articles focus on blog writing or personal branding. That's great, but it misses a crucial reality: most knowledge workers spend their days writing much more than blog posts. We're crafting Slack messages, documenting code, sending executive updates, and trying to keep up with endless internal communication.

These articles also tend to skip over the nitty-gritty of getting voice into text files. It turns out that's surprisingly challenging, especially on phones and watches with their sandboxed file systems. You also need to get from pure transcription to formatted markdown, handle different metadata needs, and figure out how to maintain your authentic voice through it all.

Through trial and error, I've been building two separate **knowledge work pipelines**: one for personal content (my social media posts, newsletters, and blog articles) and one for work.

Building a knowledge work pipeline can help you in many different ways, such as:

- Raise your visibility at work by quickly building daily and weekly summaries of your work to post on Confluence, Google Docs, or Slack
- Reduce your admin overhead by drafting emails and Slack messages
- Speed up your content creation by drafting newsletters and blog articles

Let's dive into the building blocks of these pipelines.

## The components of a knowledge work pipeline

There are four key components to building a knowledge work pipeline:

1. **Capture through dictation**
   - Record thoughts anywhere, anytime
   - Don't worry about perfect conditions
   - Focus on getting ideas down

2. **Data clean up**
   - Quick transcription cleanup (names, special words, etc.)
   - Add metadata and tags

3. **Route to LLMs**
   - Use Drafts Actions for personal content
   - Let AI help with formatting

4. **Generate final output**
   - Social media posts
   - Work documentation
   - Blog drafts
   - Newsletters

5. **Edit and publish**
   - Review and edit
   - Publish to blog, Confluence, Google Docs, Slack, etc.

## Capture through dictation
I've heavily relied on dictation over the years due to hand pain. A lot of built-in dictation tools have been kind of a pain to use because I'm constantly having to fiddle with punctuation and things like that. Apple's has gotten better over time, but it's still not perfect and doesn't always guess correctly (I guess because the way I speak isn't quite what they expect?).

AI dictation tools are instead typically powered by [Whisper](https://github.com/openai/whisper), OpenAI's open source audio model. The quality, accuracy, and speed are much better. (Note: if you want to dig deeper on these models, [Amgad Hasan](https://x.com/amgadgamalhasan), a friend from the [Latent Space](https://www.latent.space/) Discord published this [great write-up](https://substack.com/home/post/p-149727178) about the decent Whisper Turbo model.)

I've been experimenting with AI dictation and transcription tools, particularly [AudioPen](https://audiopen.ai/), [Whisper Memos](https://whispermemos.com/), and [superwhisper](https://superwhisper.com/). 

### AudioPen
My first experiment was with AudioPen, which is a web app with some really nice features. You basically dictate a note into it, and it will summarize the note using OpenAI and provide it along with the transcript. You can do things like categorize them or change the style of the summary, adjust the length - the developer's done a really great job of adding additional features.

The only downside of AudioPen is that it's not a native application for Mac or iOS, which can be a real hassle because it means you can't automatically move notes from one place to another. Also, because it's a web application, it sometimes has problems with not getting the full dictation or runs into errors where you lose the entire dictation, which is a huge pain. I think that happens less if you use it on a computer rather than a phone where you have things like your screen falling asleep.

I needed to find something better suited for my needs.

### Whisper Memos + Drafts
I heard about Whisper Memos by Vojtech Rinik ([X](https://x.com/_vojto), [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/rinik.net)) from David Sparks on the [Mac Power Users podcast](https://www.relay.fm/mpu), and wow - I've absolutely fallen in love with his workflow. 

Whisper Memos is a native iOS application. It doesn't have all the bells and whistles that AudioPen has, but it works on my phone and my watch and I can just hit record and it will listen and transcribe everything. It also has a private mode where it deletes everything from their servers after the transcription is done.

The real game changer though is pairing it with [Drafts](https://getdrafts.com/). Drafts has been my go-to blank page application for many years now (I use it on my phone, computers, and watch), and one of its features is the ability to set up a private email address that you can send text to. Whisper Memos can email you the transcription, so you just put your private Drafts email address into Whisper Memos and boom - everything you record goes straight to your Drafts inbox.

Why does this matter? Well, Drafts is incredibly powerful and infinitely customizable through something called [Actions](https://actions.getdrafts.com/). You can send your text to anywhere that's compatible with the Apple share sheet functionality or anything with an API because you can write custom Drafts actions. I actually use the Kit API with Drafts to automatically set up draft newsletter articles.

With Whisper Memos and Drafts, I can dictate text and then send it anywhere else quickly and easily.

### Superwhisper for Private Work
Whisper Memos is awesome for my personal dictation, but my work laptop is totally separate from my other devices, so I need a different solution. Thanks to [John Lindquist](https://x.com/johnlindquist) I recently discovered a Mac application called superwhisper that runs the Whisper model locally on your machine and doesn't pass any information to OpenAI. This is exactly what I needed for my work laptop! A lot of what I'm doing at work I can't really talk about publicly, much less pass to OpenAI, but I really need AI transcription. (I was actually trying to experiment with building my own local Whisper service, but this is much easier!)

One problem this solves for me is that sometimes the built-in Apple dictation struggles with Electron-based applications like Visual Studio Code, Cursor, Slack, and others that aren't pure native applications. With superwhisper, I can just dictate the text and it transcribes it, and then I can copy and paste it anywhere I want.


## Personal pipeline: quick and flexible
The heart of my personal setup is [Whisper Memos](https://whispermemos.com/) paired with [Drafts](https://getdrafts.com/). Here's what makes it work:

- Whisper Memos is a native iOS app that just works with my phone and watch
- It can email transcriptions directly to Drafts
- Drafts becomes my command center through its powerful [Actions](https://actions.getdrafts.com/) system
- I can send content anywhere through the Apple share sheet or APIs

## Work pipeline: private and secure
For work content, I use [superwhisper](https://superwhisper.com/), which runs [OpenAI's Whisper model](https://github.com/openai/whisper) locally on my machine. Why? Because I can't send sensitive work information to external services, and I need something that works well with Electron-based apps like VS Code, Cursor, and Slack.

(If you're interested in the technical details, [Amgad Hasan](https://x.com/amgadgamalhasan) from [Latent Space](https://www.latent.space/) wrote a [great piece](https://substack.com/home/post/p-149727178) about the Whisper Turbo model.)



### Making it real

My goal isn't perfect automation - it's about being more present in my life while still doing great work. I want to use my devices as little as possible so I can focus on my family, friends, and team.

This means:
- Building systems that work in the real world
- Accepting that some content needs human review
- Focusing on reducing friction
- Using AI to enhance, not replace, human touch

## What's next

I'm still working on several aspects, mostly around automation:
- Using Hazel or cron jobs to automate content generation
- Experimenting with agent frameworks like LangGraph, for example the[robo-blogger](https://github.com/langchain-ai/robo-blogger) project
- Managing metadata across different content types
- Tweaking my prompts to balance automation with authenticity
- Integrating with various work platforms
- Creating supporting visual assets

The key is building one piece at a time and focusing on what actually helps rather than what's technically possible.

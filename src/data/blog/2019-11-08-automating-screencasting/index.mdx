When I was recording the videos for [Upgrading AngularJS](https://www.upgradingangularjs.com/), I was using a Windows 10 laptop. Every time I wanted to shoot a video, I had to remember to hide the taskbar, hide my other windows, open up my editor and browser, and probably other things I'm forgetting.

It was really tedious.

When I switched to Mac when joining Auth0, I started researching how to automate different pieces of my writing, coding, and screencasting process.

Enter [Keyboard Maestro](https://www.keyboardmaestro.com/main/). Keyboard Maestro is an insanely powerful Mac application that lets you automate virtually _anything_ using combinations of **triggers** and **actions**.

Want to open an app when you connect to coffee shop wifi? Done.

Want to hit a single key to launch your entire development environment &mdash; including resizing all of your windows and running terminal commands? Done.

Want to trigger an end-of-day routine at 5 pm every day to force you to stop working? Done.

Keyboard Maestro has become completely essential to my workflow. The biggest help to me has been with recording screencasts. I now have a single keystroke that:

- Hides all applications
- Launches my editor (Camtasia until recently, but now Screenflow)
- Opens iTerm and runs a `teach` command, which is an alias to launch Visual Studio Code with special settings (light theme for accessibility, bells and whistles disabled, etc.)
- Resizes the front window to 1280x720 and center it.
- Opens Chrome and send it to `localhost:8000` (I can adjust this depending on the project, but that's a good standard)
- Resizes Chrome to 1280x720 and centers it.

Here's a quick video on how to do it. (Oh, the video also refers to [Karabiner Elements](https://pqrs.org/osx/karabiner/), be sure to grab that.)

If you want to master Keyboard Maestro, there's no better tool than David Sparks' [Keyboard Maestro Field Guide](https://learn.macsparky.com/p/km).

Hey there! Thanks for reading [Getting Started in Developer Relations](https://learn.samjulien.com/getting-started-in-developer-relations). I really hope you find it helpful. Rather than trying to keep an appendix in the book up to date, I've decided to make this supplementary page. That way I can add to it or update it whenever I need to and you'll always have the most recent version.

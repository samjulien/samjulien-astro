Thanks for joining Mike Ryan and I for **GroupBy: RxJS' Secret Weapon**! We hope you learned a lot about the `groupBy` operator, as well as when to use `exhaustMap`, `switchMap`, and `concatMap`!

Here's the video from [RxJS Live 2019](https://www.rxjs.live/):

Here are the slides:

- [GroupBy: RxJS' Secret Weapon](https://speakerdeck.com/samjulien/groupby-rxjs-secret-weapon-for-complex-uis)

And here is the sample code:

- [rxjs-groupby-basic](https://github.com/samjulien/rxjs-groupby-basic)

There's a branch for `mergeMap`, `concatMap`, and `switchMap` by themselves, as well as one for using `groupBy` and another to demonstrate how to extract a custom operator.

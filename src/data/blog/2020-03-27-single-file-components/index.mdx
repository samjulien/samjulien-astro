By default, the Angular CLI generates components with separate CSS and template files. If that works for you, great! If you don't like it, I have good news: it doesn't have to be this way! Let's learn how to use the CLI to generate single file components.

<Egghead url="https://egghead.io/lessons/angular-use-single-file-components-by-default-in-angular/embed?pl=angular-basics-888f" />

## Using Inline Style and Template in a Component

The first opportunity to use single file components is in the component file itself. We can change `templateUrl` to `template` and `styleUrls` to `styles` to keep everything in one file:

```ts
import { Component } from '@angular/core'

@Component({
  selector: 'app-root',
  template: `<h1>{{ title }}</h1>`,
  styles: ['h1 { color: blue }'],
})
export class AppComponent {
  title = 'egghead-angular'
}
```

Now we can just delete the CSS file and the HTML file and we've cleaned up the `app` folder pretty significantly.

## Generating Components with the Angular CLI with Inline Styles and Templates

We can also use the CLI to create these single file components. If I were to run the following command to create a component with the dry run flag (`-d`):

```bash
ng generate component habit-list -d
```

I'd see the following output:

```bash
CREATE src/app/habit-list/habit-list.component.scss (0 bytes)
CREATE src/app/habit-list/habit-list.component.html (25 bytes)
CREATE src/app/habit-list/habit-list.component.spec.ts (650 bytes)
CREATE src/app/habit-list/habit-list.component.ts (285 bytes)
UPDATE src/app/app.module.ts (1104 bytes)

NOTE: The "dryRun" flag means no changes were made.
```

You can see that the default output is to have a CSS file and an HTML file in addition to the spec and the component. I can change this by adding two flags to this command:

```bash
ng generate component habit-list --inline-style --inline-template -d
```

This will show us the following output:

```bash
CREATE src/app/habit-list/habit-list.component.spec.ts (650 bytes)
CREATE src/app/habit-list/habit-list.component.ts (267 bytes)
UPDATE src/app/app.module.ts (1104 bytes)

NOTE: The "dryRun" flag means no changes were made.
```

Only a component and spec file! Let's go ahead and run that without the dry run flag to create the component:

```bash
ng generate component habit-list --inline-style --inline-template
```

You should see a `habit-list` folder with just the component and the spec. If you open up that component, you can see the inline template and styles:

```ts
import { Component, OnInit } from '@angular/core'

@Component({
  selector: 'app-habit-list',
  template: `
    <p>
      habit-list works!
    </p>
  `,
  styles: [],
})
export class HabitListComponent implements OnInit {
  constructor() {}

  ngOnInit(): void {}
}
```

## Generating Single File Components with the Angular CLI By Default

We can actually go one step further though and make this the default behavior of the component schematic. If we open up `angular.json`, which is the JSON file that configures the Angular CLI, there's a section here for `schematics` that lets you override the defaults. If we create a `@schematics/angular:component` key there, we can set the default values we want for the command flags:

```json
{
  "$schema": "./node_modules/@angular/cli/lib/config/schema.json",
  "version": 1,
  "newProjectRoot": "projects",
  "projects": {
    "demo": {
      "root": "",
      "sourceRoot": "src",
      "projectType": "application",
      "prefix": "app",
      "schematics": {
        "@schematics/angular:component": {
          "inlineStyle": true,
          "inlineTemplate": true
        }
      },
      `...
    }
  }
}
```

If you're using the [Angular Essentials VS Code extensions](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=johnpapa.angular-essentials), you should be able to just type "component" and get intellisense for the key so you don't have to remember it.

Let's run another dry run command to generate a new component, this time using the alias `ng g c`:

```bash
ng g c habit-detail -d
```

You can see that now the default is just to create the component and the spec:

```bash
CREATE src/app/habit-detail/habit-detail.component.spec.ts (650 bytes)
CREATE src/app/habit-detail/habit-detail.component.ts (267 bytes)
UPDATE src/app/app.module.ts (1104 bytes)

NOTE: The "dryRun" flag means no changes were made.
```

Let's run that without the dry run flag. You should now see now a `habit-detail` folder with just the component and the spec. If you open up the component, you can see we now just have the template and the styles inline:

```ts
import { Component, OnInit } from '@angular/core'

@Component({
  selector: 'app-habit-detail',
  template: `
    <p>
      habit-detail works!
    </p>
  `,
  styles: [],
})
export class HabitDetailComponent implements OnInit {
  constructor() {}

  ngOnInit(): void {}
}
```

That's it! Here's the final code:

## Where to Go Next

Single file components in Angular are a matter of personal preference. I prefer to have only one file I have to keep track of and a lot of small components rather than several big components. I do this by default anytime I set up a new Angular project. If you prefer the standard way with separate files, that's totally fine. The most important thing is that your team does it consistently in a repo!

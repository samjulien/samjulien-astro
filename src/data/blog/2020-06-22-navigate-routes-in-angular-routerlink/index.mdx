Once routing is set up, we can add a new route by adding a new component and adding a path to our routes array in `app.module.ts`. But how do we navigate between the two routes? In this lesson of Angular Basics, I'll show you how to use `routerLink` to switch between the routes without causing the page to refresh.

Here's the video lesson:

<Egghead url="https://egghead.io/lessons/angular-navigate-between-routes-in-angular-with-routerlink/embed?pl=angular-basics-888f&af=6zxcwn" />

## Add a New Component with the Angular CLI

To create a new route, we'll first need to create a new Angular component using the CLI. We can do this by running the command:

```bash
ng g c account
```

> The command `ng g c` is an abbreviation for `ng generate component`.

## Add a New Route

Once the CLI finished creating the component, we can go over to `app.module.ts` and add a new route to the `Routes` array:

```ts
// app.module.ts
const routes: Routes = [
  { path: 'home', component: HomeComponent },
  { path: 'account', component: AccountComponent },
  { path: '', redirectTo: '/home', pathMatch: 'full' },
]
```

When you run `ng serve` and check out `localhost:4200` in the browser, you should now be able to navigate to both `/` and `/account` and see their respective components. That's okay, but it'd be better if we could link between the routes in a navigation bar.

## Add Links to Each Route

Let's head over to `app.component.html` and add a simple nav component. If you're using Visual Studio Code, you can use Emmett right out of the box to generate this HTML by typing `nav>ul>li*2>a`. This will generate the following:

```html
<!-- app.component.html -->
<nav>
  <ul>
    <li><a href=""></a></li>
    <li><a href=""></a></li>
  </ul>
</nav>
```

Go ahead and update this with our two routes:

```html
<!-- app.component.html -->
<nav>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="/">Home</a></li>
    <li><a href="/account">Account</a></li>
  </ul>
</nav>
```

If you go back over the browser and click these links, what do you notice? The page is actually refreshing every time we click a link. We don't want that! Even though it doesn't seem like a big deal for this example, we're losing any sort of **app state** when we refresh the page. If we were keeping track of any data, such as from input fields, they'd reset every time the link was clicked.

We can avoid this by using the [routerLink directive](https://angular.io/api/router/RouterLink) that Angular provides. Replace `href` with `routerLink` like so:

```html
<!-- app.component.html -->
<nav>
  <ul>
    <li><a routerLink="/">Home</a></li>
    <li><a routerLink="/account">Account</a></li>
  </ul>
</nav>
```

Now when we click between the routes, the page no longer refreshes. Awesome!

I love [Angular](http://www.angular.io). I'll admit that one reason I love it is because of the way it impacted my career, but that was only possible because of how amazing the Angular community is. It's friendly, supportive, and collaborative. I wrote more about that in [my retro post about 2018](/ask-for-help-2018).

Aside from the community, though, I do love the Angular framework for its power and scalability. You can build _massive_ enterprise apps with Angular due to its robust tooling and the magic of RxJS.

Unfortunately, this power comes at the price of a steep learning curve. Angular can be really tough to learn, _especially_ for beginners. It tends to slide right into place for folks coming for C# and Java, but for new frontend developers, it's just not that easy. TypeScript is one leap, followed by the dizzying jargon of RxJS.

For this reason, I decided to build a free egghead collection of Angular Basics lessons. I'll be adding to it gradually each week for a while (until I run out of ideas, I suppose).

Here's the first lesson about creating your first Angular app:

Hope you enjoy it and learn to love Angular as much as I do!

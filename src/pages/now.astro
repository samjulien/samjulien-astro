      This is my <a href="https://nownownow.com/about" target="_blank" class="text-brand hover:text-brand-dark">now page</a>, inspired by Derek Sivers. It's a snapshot of what I'm focused on at this point in my life.
    </p>
    
    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Current focus</h2>
    <p>
      I have two main focuses right now: 
      <ol>
        <li>Provide for my family while spending as much time as possible with them</li>
        <li>Help developers around the world navigate the rapidly changing landscape of AI engineering and its impact on traditional web and software development</li>
      </ol>
    </p>
    
    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Personal</h2>
    <p>I'm having a great time with my wife, son, and dog in the Pacific Northwest. Currently spending a lot of time playing with my son at parks, playgrounds, and out in nature whenever the weather permits. His language is developing rapidly and it's a ton of fun to watch.</p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Creative work</h2>
    <p>Over the last year, I've gotten back into writing and coding. I <a href="/migrating-from-gatsby-to-astro" class="text-brand hover:text-brand-dark">rebuilt this website with Astro</a>, wrote a series on <a href="/building-a-developer-motion" class="text-brand hover:text-brand-dark">building a developer motion</a> and a series on <a href="/understanding-burnout" class="text-brand hover:text-brand-dark">preventing and managing burnout using a progress system</a>, and am now working on building an AI-powered knowledge work pipeline. I'm also sending more updates out via my newsletter, so be sure to sign up below.</p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Day job</h2>
    <p>I'm currently working as the Director of Developer Relations at <a href="https://writer.com" target="_blank" class="text-brand hover:text-brand-dark">Writer</a>, an enterprise AI platform, where I lead a team of Developer Experience (DX) engineers. I oversee all of our <a href="https://dev.writer.com/" target="_blank" class="text-brand hover:text-brand-dark">developer docs and SDKs</a>. I also co-lead all of our technical and developer marketing alongside the Product Marketing team. I recently oversaw all of the engineering and marketing for our <a href="https://writer.com/engineering/sdk-2-0/" target="_blank" class="text-brand hover:text-brand-dark">SDK 2.0 release</a> and our <a href="https://writer.com/engineering/langchain-writer/" target="_blank" class="text-brand hover:text-brand-dark">LangChain</a> and <a href="https://python.useinstructor.com/integrations/writer/" target="_blank" class="text-brand hover:text-brand-dark">Instructor</a> integrations. I also led a cross-functional team in sponsoring <a href="https://www.ai.engineer/summit" target="_blank" class="text-brand hover:text-brand-dark">AI Engineer Summit</a>.</p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Learning</h2>
    <p>Here's what I'm currently learning:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Diving deeper into AI engineering, especially evals and inference</li>
      <li>Scratching the surface of Machine Learning and Deep Learning</li>
      <li>Slow productivity</li>
    </ul>

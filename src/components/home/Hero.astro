      It's really nice to meet you. I'm a director of Developer Relations (currently at <a href="https://writer.com" target="_blank">Writer</a>, previously at <a href="https://auth0.com" target="_blank">Auth0/Okta</a>), 
      an instructor for <a href="https://egghead.io" target="_blank">egghead</a>, and the author of <a href="http://www.gettingstartedindevrel.com" target="_blank">Getting Started in Developer Relations</a>. I live in the PNW with my family and our scruffy dog and love spending time outside whenever I can.

      Growing in your career as a developer or developer advocate is not easy. I'm here to help you 
      as best I can, not by giving you vague motivational speeches, but by sharing practical <strong>microskills</strong> 
      that compound and become transformative.

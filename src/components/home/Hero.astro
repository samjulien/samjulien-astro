    <p>
      It's really nice to meet you. I'm a Product Manager focused on developer tools and AI (currently at <a href="https://writer.com" target="_blank">WRITER</a>, an enterprise AI platform). I spent years leading Developer Relations at <a href="https://auth0.com" target="_blank">Auth0/Okta</a>, which gave me a deep understanding of how developers think and what they actually need from products. I also wrote <a href="http://www.gettingstartedindevrel.com" target="_blank">Getting Started in Developer Relations</a>. I live in the PNW with my family and our scruffy dog and love spending time outside whenever I can. Learn what I'm up to on my <a href="/now" class="text-brand hover:text-brand-dark">now page</a> and what gear and software I use on my <a href="/uses" class="text-brand hover:text-brand-dark">uses page</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Growing as a product leader, an engineer, or any kind of knowledge worker is not easy. I'm here to help you
      as best I can, not by giving you vague motivational speeches, but by sharing practical <strong>microskills</strong>
      that compound and become transformative.
